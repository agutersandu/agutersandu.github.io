## Research Projects

I develop interactive tools and research to explore how different countries finance their green energy transitions, and who bears the costs.

    <p><strong>About This Project</strong></p>
    
    <p>This interactive tool explores how the United Kingdom chose to finance its green energy transition—and how different that choice looks compared to other countries. It draws on research presented in my paper on securitising system costs, which examines how the UK has placed the costs of decarbonisation on electricity bill payers and network charges.</p>
    
    <p>Although all countries need to fund their green transitions, they have made fundamentally different choices about where in the economy those costs are placed. Rather than consumers' energy bills, other countries channel these costs through different routes. This tool visualises how the UK's choice—placing costs on energy bills—affects households at different income levels.</p>
    
    <p><em><strong>Important note:</strong> This is not an argument against green energy transitions (which are essential) or in favour of fossil fuels. Rather, it shows that how we pay for energy infrastructure—whether fossil fuel or renewable—is a policy choice. Electricity infrastructure of any kind must be financed somehow; the question is not whether to pay for it, but where those costs are placed in the economy and who bears them. Examining alternative financing mechanisms can help us think about fairer ways to distribute these costs.</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>How Different Countries Place Transition Costs:</strong></p>
    
    <div class="financing-method">
      <h4>🇫🇷 France: State Budget Financing</h4>
      <p>France largely finances renewable electricity support through the state budget, rather than relying on a dedicated renewables levy applied to electricity bills. In budget documentation citing the French energy regulator's CRE forecasts, the net cost to the state of renewable electricity support mechanisms is projected at approximately €7.7 billion in 2026. In other words, the funding flow is: <strong>taxpayers → state budget → renewable electricity support mechanisms</strong>, rather than consumers' electricity bills → renewable policy costs.</p>

    <div class="financing-method">
      <h4>🇩🇰 Denmark: Community Ownership</h4>
      <p>Denmark reduces the extent to which transition costs are concentrated on all consumers by enabling—and in some cases requiring—local participation in project ownership. When the Middelgrunden offshore wind farm was built in 2000, around 8,500 citizens invested roughly €23 million to own 50% of the project, with reported returns in the region of 7% per year historically, and depending on performance. More broadly, since the 2009 Renewable Energy Act, developers of new wind projects must offer at least 20% ownership to local residents. This approach spreads costs and benefits across participating stakeholder-investors rather than allocating costs uniformly through all consumers' bills.</p>

    <div class="financing-method">
      <h4>🇨🇳 China: State-Directed Finance and Industrial Policy</h4>
      <p>China's renewable expansion is strongly shaped by state-directed capital allocation, development finance, and industrial policy. State-owned enterprises remain central in the power sector—particularly in generation asset ownership and the grid—whilst private firms participate in renewables development and play a major role in manufacturing (especially in parts of the solar supply chain). The net effect is a transition financed and steered primarily through policy and state-influenced capital flows, with a mixed ecosystem of state and private actors operating within that framework.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="financing-method">
      <h4>🇧🇷 Brazil: Blended Finance</h4>
      <p>Brazil uses blended finance structures where public money is designed to catalyse much larger volumes of private investment. Under initiatives such as Eco Invest, the Treasury provides capital to financial institutions at low cost (reported around 1% interest), with explicit leverage objectives (at least 4:1), and early results reported at higher mobilisation levels. In parallel, Brazil's electricity market structure can split cost allocation across segments: large consumers in the free contracting environment (ACL) can procure renewable electricity through bilateral power purchase agreements (PPAs), rather than solely through regulated, system-wide cost recovery.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Understanding these alternatives helps us ask:</strong> What other ways might we fund the green transition, and would they distribute the burden more fairly?</p>
