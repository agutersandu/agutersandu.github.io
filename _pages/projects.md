- [Low-Carbon Levy Burden Explorer](/projects/levy-burden-explorer/)

- ## Overview

The transition to a low-carbon economy is essential in addressing climate change, yet the way countries choose to finance this transition varies significantly. The costs of transitioning energy systems are distributed differently across economies depending on the financing mechanisms they deploy. This project explores how different countries structure their green energy financing and what this reveals about the political economy of climate action.

Consider how four major economies approach this challenge:

**France** has traditionally relied on nuclear power and state-owned utilities to manage energy system transitions, using centralized financing mechanisms. **Denmark** pioneered a different model, leveraging wind energy cooperatives and distributed ownership structures. In contrast, many **Latin American countries** face constraints in accessing international climate finance while managing existing debt burdens and limited fiscal space. **China** has pursued a state-directed approach, mobilizing vast capital through state-owned enterprises and development banks to finance renewable energy expansion and grid modernization.

For a deeper analysis of how system costs are distributed across different national contexts, see my working paper "Securitising System Costs: The United Kingdom's Arm's-Length Derisking Regime for the Green Transition" (2025), available in my [publications](/publications/).
