I'm an Assistant Professor of International Political Economy at the **University of Bath** and a Senior Researcher at the **Global Climate Forum** in Berlin. My research examines how states mobilise financial resources to pursue ambitious objectives—from war and reconstruction to energy transitions and climate action—particularly when these goals appear fiscally or politically unaffordable under conventional budget constraints.

## Current Research

<div class="project-highlight">
I lead <strong>FINTRANS-UK</strong>, an ESRC-funded research project investigating the hidden mechanics of how Britain has repeatedly funded the seemingly unaffordable across history. Drawing on archival research, longitudinal and administrative data, and semi-structured interviews, the project traces how the UK has engaged in public finance innovation to circumvent fiscal constraints and mobilise private capital for public purposes—from the <em>Exchange Equalisation Account</em>'s role as a wartime off-balance-sheet fiscal agency, through the extraordinary public investment that built the post-war electricity system, and specialist vehicles such as the <em>Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation</em> and <em>Finance Corporation for Industry</em> that filled financing gaps for industry, to today's arm's-length, market-shaping approach to financing the UK's Green Transition.

## Earlier Research

My earlier research explored the so-called financialisation of social policy and especially the rise of outcome-based finance. I examined how investors and social innovators construct markets around paying for results in education, employment and criminal justice. This work analysed how public policy experimentation reshapes power relations between those who design and deliver public programmes, and who counts as a credible participant. More recent work examines efforts to construct markets around development outcomes in climate finance.
