I'm an Assistant Professor of International Political Economy at the **University of Bath** and a Senior Researcher at the **Global Climate Forum** in Berlin. My research examines how states mobilise financial resources to pursue ambitious objectives—from war and reconstruction to energy transitions and climate action—particularly when these goals appear fiscally or politically unaffordable under conventional budget constraints.

<h3 class="section-header">Current Research</h3>

<div class="project-highlight">
I lead <strong>FINTRANS-UK</strong>, an ESRC-funded research project investigating the hidden mechanics of how Britain has repeatedly funded the seemingly unaffordable across history. Drawing on archival research at the Bank of England and the British National Archives, the project traces how the UK has engaged in fiscal innovation to circumvent fiscal constraints and mobilise private capital for public purposes—from the extraordinary public investment that built the UK's post-war electricity system through the <em>Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation</em> and <em>Finance Corporation for Industry</em>, to the <em>Exchange Equalisation Account</em>'s role as a wartime off-balance-sheet fiscal agency, to today's arm's-length derisking regime for green infrastructure investment.

This historical work sits within a broader research agenda on the **political economy of energy transitions**, **the evolution of monetary and financial systems**, and **the changing nature of state capacity**. Together with colleagues at the Global Climate Forum, I investigate how states use off-balance-sheet fiscal agencies to reconfigure fiscal governance to finance large-scale transitions. 

Recent work examines green macro-financial governance in the European monetary architecture, assessing the capacity of Eurozone institutions to finance the net-zero transition; the Recovery and Resilience Facility as "Schrödinger's off-balance-sheet fiscal agency" that is simultaneously on and off the EU budget; and comparative historical analyses of off-balance-sheet fiscal agencies in wartime economies (Germany 1914-1918 and 1933-1945, Britain 1939-1945) and post-war reconstruction.

<h3 class="section-header">Earlier Research</h3>

My earlier research explored the so-called financialisation of social policy through outcome-based finance markets and social impact bonds, examining how social impact is conceived, measured, and accounted for when financial instruments are used to fund social services. This work on valuation processes, contract design, and the governance of public services through private financial markets informs my current focus on how states use private financial actors, instruments, and markets in governing grand challenges.

<h3 class="section-header">Background</h3>

I hold a PhD in International Political Economy from **City, University of London**, and was previously an ESRC Postdoctoral Fellow at the **London School of Economics** and a Research Officer on the QUAD project at LSE's **Centre for Analysis of Risk and Regulation**. My research has been published in *Competition and Change*, *Environment and Planning A*, *Journal of European Integration*, *New Political Economy*, and other leading journals. I supervise doctoral research on climate finance, energy systems, and the geopolitics of finance.
