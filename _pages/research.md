<h3>FINTRANS-UK: Financing Large-Scale British Transformations</h3>

<p>I lead <strong>FINTRANS-UK</strong>, an ESRC-funded research project investigating the hidden mechanics of how Britain has repeatedly funded the seemingly unaffordable across history. Drawing on archival research at the Bank of England and the British National Archives, the project traces how the UK has used off-balance-sheet fiscal agencies (OBFAs), special finance vehicles, and quasi-fiscal innovations to circumvent fiscal discipline and mobilise private capital for public purposes.</p>

## Research Agenda

My research sits at the intersection of political economy, climate finance, and state capacity. I investigate three interconnected themes:

<div class="theme-box">
<h4>1. Political Economy of Energy Transitions</h4>

<p>How do states finance large-scale transformations of their energy systems when facing surging demand and technological shifts? My research examines <strong>critical historical junctures</strong> when states confronted the challenge of building entirely new energy infrastructures—moments when existing systems proved inadequate and massive capital mobilisation became essential. These transitions share a common puzzle: how to finance infrastructures that appear fiscally unaffordable yet are deemed necessary for economic development, national security, or climate action.</p>

<p>I trace how Britain navigated such transitions across different eras: from the post-war challenge of electrifying the nation to today's imperative to rebuild the electricity system around <strong>renewable generation</strong>. Contemporary transitions add complexity through the <strong>renewables-security nexus</strong>—as states pursue energy independence while managing new vulnerabilities around supply chains, critical minerals, and grid resilience. Each transition required states to innovate financially, creating new instruments and governance arrangements to mobilize private capital for fundamentally public infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>This comparative approach reveals recurring patterns in how states reconfigure their <strong>fiscal and financial architectures</strong> when confronted with energy system transformations—from post-war development finance institutions to contemporary contracts-for-difference and derisking regimes.</p>

</div>

<div class="theme-box">
<h4>2. Evolution of Monetary and Financial Systems</h4>

<p>How do monetary and financial systems transform under the pressure of extraordinary state objectives? This research examines how <strong>wartime mobilisation and post-war reconstruction</strong> fundamentally reshaped modern finance. Wars represent extreme moments when states must finance objectives on a scale that dwarfs peacetime expenditure, forcing fiscal and financial innovations that permanently alter how these systems operate.</p>

<p>I analyse these transformations comparatively across different episodes: Germany during WWI (1914-1918) developed elaborate mechanisms to finance total war while appearing to maintain fiscal orthodoxy; Nazi Germany (1933-1945) pioneered <strong>camouflaged sovereign borrowing</strong> through specialised financial vehicles; Britain's WWII experience (1939-1945) saw the Exchange Equalisation Account repurposed as a wartime fiscal agency. Post-war reconstruction then demanded new institutions to rebuild industrial capacity when conventional public finance appeared inadequate.</p>

<p>These historical episodes reveal how extraordinary demands generate <strong>financial innovations</strong> that persist long after the immediate crisis—fiscal agencies, special purpose vehicles, and quasi-fiscal operations that became enduring features of modern state finance.</p>

</div>

<div class="theme-box">
<h4>3. Changing Nature of State Capacity</h4>

<p>How has state capacity been reconfigured through the increasing use of <strong>private financial actors, instruments, and markets</strong> to govern public challenges? This research traces how states have progressively restructured their governing functions by turning to innovative financial mechanisms when direct public provision appears fiscally or politically untenable—representing a fundamental shift from direct provision toward orchestrating private capital through sophisticated financial engineering.</p>

<p>My earlier research at LSE examined <strong>outcome-based finance and social impact bonds</strong> as mechanisms for funding social services. These instruments reflected states delegating not just financing but also risk, performance measurement, and policy implementation to private financial markets—reimagining state capacity as contract design and risk management rather than direct service provision.</p>

<p>Whether financing social services through impact bonds, electricity infrastructure through contracts-for-difference, or war through special fiscal vehicles, states repeatedly reconfigure capacity by enlisting private financial actors. The common thread reveals state capacity as not a fixed attribute, but a <strong>flexible repertoire of financial and institutional arrangements</strong> that states continuously adapt to meet extraordinary demands.</p>

## Research Projects

<div class="project-box">
<h4>Off-Balance-Sheet Fiscal Agencies in Historical Perspective</h4>
<p>Comparative historical analyses of off-balance-sheet fiscal agencies in wartime economies (Germany 1914-1918, Germany 1933-1945, Britain 1939-1945) and post-war reconstruction.</p>
</div>

<div class="project-box">
<h4>Recovery and Resilience Facility</h4>
<p>Analysis of the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility as "Schrödinger's off-balance-sheet fiscal agency" that is simultaneously on and off the EU budget.</p>
</div>

<div class="project-box">
<h4>Financialisation of Social Policy</h4>
<p>My earlier research explored outcome-based finance markets and social impact bonds, examining how social impact is conceived, measured, and accounted for when financial instruments are used to fund social services.</p>

## Methodological Approach

My research combines:

- **Archival research** at institutions like the Bank of England and British National Archives
- **Historical institutional analysis** to trace policy evolution
- **Comparative political economy** methods
- **Policy document analysis** and interviews with key stakeholders
