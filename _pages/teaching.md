I teach courses in international political economy, with a focus on climate finance, energy transitions, state capacity, and global economic governance. My teaching emphasises critical engagement with contemporary policy challenges and historical perspectives on political and economic transformation.

## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach combines theoretical rigor with policy relevance. I encourage students to:

- Engage critically with dominant narratives in political economy
- Draw connections between historical cases and contemporary challenges  
- Understand the political stakes in seemingly technical economic debates
- Develop analytical skills for assessing policy proposals and institutional reforms

I supervise undergraduate and postgraduate dissertations on topics related to political economy, climate finance, energy transitions, and international economic governance. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in discussing potential dissertation topics or research projects!
